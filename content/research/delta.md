- Pre-processed 6B+ lines of Delta Supercomputer system logs, removing duplicates and high noise with error coalescing and keyword matching
- Boosted processing speed by 100x using Hyperscan and Python multiprocessing for efficient error extraction and analysis
- Analyzed GPU failure modes for AI workloads, studying error distribution, causality, and concurrence for NVLink and memory errors, and assessed user application impact
- Investigated error persistence and recovery paths based on NVIDIA Ampere architecture, extracting actionable insights for system reliability
