#### Overview
This project investigates congruence relations for colored partitions of integers. We explore congruences of the form pr(mn + t) ≡ 0 (mod p) for all n, where pr(n) represents the number of r-colored partitions of n and p, m are distinct primes. We discuss the background of Ramanujan's congruences and the interest they sparked among number theorists. We then introduce theta-type congruences, which are nontrivial congruences that do not follow from Ramanujan-type congruences and provide examples and remarks to illustrate their findings. 

#### Contributions
- Played a crucial role in the investigation of congruence relations for colored partitions of integers.
- Explored the background of Ramanujan's congruences and introduced theta-type congruences as nontrivial congruences.
- Utilized Mathematica for the generation of numerical data, with a specific focus on the case with even R’s.
- Demonstrated a deep understanding of mathematical principles and identified interesting congruences within the data.
- Actively participated in group meetings with colleagues Jamie and Maddie, explaining technical procedures implemented in Mathematica to ensure clear communication and alignment within the team.

#### Achievements
- Enriched mathematical knowledge through active participation in the IGL project.
- Developed important skills such as teamwork, communication, and technical proficiency.
- Contributed to a paper detailing the investigation of congruence relations for colored partitions of integers, which has been accepted for publication in the prestigious Journal of Number Theory.
