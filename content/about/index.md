### MS student in Computer Engineering seeking an internship in software engineering for Summer 2024 (no sponsorship needed)

I am a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master’s in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am affiliated with the DEPEND Research Group at UIUC and actively engaged in research. My academic interests include autonomous vehicles, machine learning, cloud computing, and computer vision.

I enjoy exploring new things, whether trying different restaurants or using technology. I’m good at spotting problems and trying to make them better. I also enjoy taking apart and putting together electronic devices like keyboards, computers, and car radios.

I listen to podcasts about staying healthy and discovering new music when driving. It’s all about having fun and learning new things!
