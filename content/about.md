### MS student seeking an internship in software engineering for summer 2024

I am a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I like trying out new things, from restaurants to technology.  I have a passion for disassembling and reassembling various electronic devices and gadgets, including car head units, personal computers, laptops, smartphones, keyboards, and mice. I can put them back together most of the time. When driving, I enjoy listening to podcasts that focus on health-related topics and exploring novel music selections.

I am affiliated with the DEPEND Group at UIUC and actively engaged in research. 


### Academic Interests
autonomous vehicles, machine learning, cloud computing, and computer vision.
