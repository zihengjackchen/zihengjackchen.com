### First-year Master's student seeking an internship in software engineering and related fields for summer 2024.
I am a first-year master's student in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am interested in software development, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, machine learning, and computer vision. 

I like trying out new things, from restaurants to technology. I like taking apart electronics and gadgets: car head units, PCs, laptops, smartphones, keyboards, mice, you name it. I can put them back together most of the time. When driving, I enjoy listening to health-related podcasts or exploring new music.


**Academic Interests**: Autonomous Vehicles, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing (soon)
