I’m Jack (陈自衡), a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), set to graduate in May 2025.  

I have gained industry experience through internships at [Talos Trading](/experience/talos-sre), [StoneX Group](/experience/stonex-mle), and [Ecolab](/experience/ecolab-data-intern), where I specialized in optimizing system performance, enhancing infrastructure reliability, and streamlining processes through rapid prototyping and automation.  

My academic journey is deeply rooted in research within the [DEPEND Group](https://depend.csl.illinois.edu/), where I focus on leveraging machine learning to improve system dependability. I've contributed to projects in [autonomous vehicle safety](/research/iprism), and [GPU reliability in data centers](/research/delta).  

I’m passionate about building scalable, resilient systems and continuously expanding my technical expertise to tackle real-world challenges. I enjoy making my work accessible and useful to others, so I occasionally publish the tools I develop on [GitHub](https://github.com/zihengjackchen).
