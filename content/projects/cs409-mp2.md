#### Description

#### Task
In this programming assignment, I've been tasked with creating a front-end interface using React that consumes an API. It's essential to read through the entire assignment before starting.

#### Requirements
The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

- **Create a single-page React app** that allows users to interact with data from one of the provided APIs, which could be one of the following:
   - [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
   - [Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/)
   - [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html)
   - [Marvel](https://developer.marvel.com/)
   - [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/)
   - [Balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io/)
   - [Art Institute of Chicago](https://api.artic.edu/docs/)

   **Note**: It might be necessary to create an account and obtain an API key for some of these APIs.

- If the API you are working with becomes temporarily unavailable, you can **mock the data**. This means you can create a local hardcoded response and use that instead of making actual API requests.

- You should be prepared to deal with APIs that have **rate-limiting policies**, and you may need to find ways to work around them, such as caching the results of large and common API calls.

- Consider how your app should handle errors, as these are also opportunities to think about error handling.

The app I'm creating should include the following features:

- **A list view**: Users should be able to input a query into a search bar, and the app should return a list of results that match the query. It's possible to search for different types of data, like movies or Pokemon. Users should also have the option to sort the search results based on various properties and specify an ordering (ascending or descending). The search bar should filter the results as users type. Sorting and filtering can be done on the client side.

- **A gallery view**: This view should display some form of image media from the chosen API, such as a gallery of movie posters. The gallery view should include attributes that allow users to select one or more criteria to filter the gallery, like genres of films or music.

- **A detail view**: When a user clicks on an item in the search view or the gallery view, the app should display the various attributes of the selected item. This view should also have previous and next buttons (possibly implemented with arrows) to allow users to cycle through the list of objects. The detail view should have a specific route, meaning that users should be able to access it through a unique URL.

To accomplish this assignment, I'm required to use the following tools:

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) for handling routing within the app.
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for making API calls.
- Either [PropTypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) for type checking or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) for enhanced type safety in React.

To get an idea of what the finished app should look like, I can refer to an old example provided [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmDZuAr7QJE). This example meets the specified requirements.
