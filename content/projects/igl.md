#### Overview
This project investigates congruence relations for colored partitions of integers. We explore congruences of the form pr(mn + t) ≡ 0 (mod p) for all n, where pr(n) represents the number of r-colored partitions of n and p, m are distinct primes. We discuss the background of Ramanujan's congruences and the interest they sparked among number theorists. We then introduce theta-type congruences, which are nontrivial congruences that do not follow from Ramanujan-type congruences and provide examples and remarks to illustrate their findings.
