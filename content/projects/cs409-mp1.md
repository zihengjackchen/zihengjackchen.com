#### Description
#### Task

In this programming assignment, I have designed and implemented a single-page website with specified functionality and formatting using only HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. The content of the website is up to me. For example, I've chosen to create a webpage for a company/organization, a product, or a personal/portfolio page. This assignment has given me first-hand experience with HTML5 (e.g., header, canvas, video), CSS3/SASS (e.g., use of webfonts, animations, layout), and Javascript (ES5 or ES6).

#### Requirements

My webpage had to implement the features listed below. I didn't have to make my webpage look similar to the examples provided, but I needed to incorporate each feature in some form.

1. **Layout**: I've structured all the content on a single page with full-width horizontal stripes/sections, including a header and a footer - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/2.png)
2. **Sticky Navbar**: I created a top navigation bar that sticks to the top of the window when scrolling - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/3.gif)
3. **Position Indicator**: I've added an indicator of the current reading position, visible in the navigation bar (as shown in the above gif for example). My implementation ensured that the last menu item is highlighted when scrolling to the bottom of the page. To achieve this, I had to figure out which section lay directly below the bottom margin of the navigation bar by using methods that provided the height and position of different divs. This computation was updated whenever a scroll event occurred.
4. **Navbar Resizing**: My navigation bar became larger when users were at the top of the page and resized to become smaller as users scrolled down. The text font size also adjusted accordingly - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/4.gif)
5. **Smooth Scrolling**: I implemented smooth scrolling when navigating to different sections using the navigation bar - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/5.gif)
6. **Carousel**: I created a section with a carousel/slider featuring a minimum of three slides, including navigation arrows on the side - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/6.gif)
7. **Multi-column layout**: I designed a section with multi-column content - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/8.png)
8. **Centering**: Content in each horizontal stripe/section is horizontally centered. Additionally, I ensured that at least one element on the page remained vertically centered, even if the dimensions of its outer element changed.
9. **Responsiveness**: My webpage looks good when resized to the following resolutions:
   - 1920x1080
   - 1366x768
   - 1280x720
   - 1024x768
10. **Background Image**: I used a fixed-position background image in one of the sections - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/9.gif)
11. **Modal**: I incorporated modal windows with additional content in a section - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/10.gif)
12. **Video**: I embedded a video using the HTML5 video tag - [Example](https://uiuc-web-programming.gitlab.io/sp20/images/mp1/11_2.gif)
13. **CSS3 Animations**: I included at least one use of CSS3 animations, such as fade in/out or transitions.
14. **Scalable Vector Icons**: I made use of scalable vector icons through CSS, such as FontAwesome.
15. **Inclusion of Social Media Icons**: I included social media icons on my webpage.
